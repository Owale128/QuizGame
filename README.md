# Quiz Game - Next.Js! 😃

This web-based quiz project allows users to participate in a quiz and see their results. Built with React and Next.js, it consists of four main parts. On the home page, the user can enter their username and be redirected to the quiz. In the quiz section, questions are presented with multiple answers, and the project tracks time and scores as the user navigates between questions. After the quiz, the result is displayed on a results page where the user can see their score and choose to either see the highest score or restart the game. A high score page shows the top five results. Local storage is used to save usernames and results, and API calls are used to retrieve queries and top results.
